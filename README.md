# MoonshotProject

At the moment, I haven't proposed my idea of the project, yet I have a few ideas in mind. I will be updating this README as I go along. My current and main idea, would be to create an application that recognize clothes using an AI, based on a photo, a screenshot or any picture. I also don't have a name yet, but I'm opened to suggestions.
## How will it work?

The user will be able to take a picture of a piece of clothing or directly import it in the application, and it will recognize the clothing and give the user the reference and a link to a site where it can be found, so the user can buy it. The application will also be able to recognize the color of the clothing and give the user the reference of the color, so the user can buy the same color of the clothing. All of the recognization process will be done using an AI. I will also need to create a database, so I can store the information of the clothes and colors. The hardest part of the project will be to train the AI to recognize clothes and colors. As for one brand, there are thousand of products with multiple colors. But also to keep it updated, as the clothes and colors will change every season and new products are released every day.

## What will I need?

I will need to learn how to use an AI, and how to use it to recognize clothes and colors. I will also need to learn how to use a database, so I can store the information of the clothes and colors. 

## Why will I do it?

Nowadays, it is very hard to find a piece of clothing that you like, and that you can afford. I think that this application will help people to find the clothes that they like, and that they can afford. But also because we often see influencers wearing clothes that we like, but we don't know where to find them. This application will help us to find the clothes that we like, and that we see in the influencers. Even though in the beginning, the application will only recognize clothes from a few brands, I think that it will be a good start. I want to get a wide range of users, so I can get a lot of feedback, and improve the application.

## Monetization

The monetization of the application is an important part of the project, as I want to make the app totally free to use. The way that I have thought of monetizing it would be to use sponsored links. For example, if the user is looking for a piece of clothing, and the application finds it, it will give the user a link to the website where the clothing is sold. But if the user clicks on the link, the application will get a small commission. It's the fairest way to monetize the application, as the user will be able to find the clothing that he wants without to spend a penny, and the application will get a small commission.
